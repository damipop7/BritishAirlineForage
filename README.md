# BritishAirlineForage


This is my work with British Airlines on Forage for a data science job simulation. 

### Task 1: Web scraping to gain company insights
In this task, I learned how data scientists at British Airways apply analytical skills to make a tangible impact by providing recommendations, tools, and models that drive key business decisions. 
British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. As a data scientist at BA, my job was to apply my analytical skills to influence real-life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as my recommendations, tools, and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs, and increase revenue.
I also scraped data from the web (Skytrax) and collected customer feedback by analyzing third-party data and findings were summarized using Jupyter Notebook. Finally, my findings were visualized for presentation using PowerPoint/ Keynote.

### Task 2: Predicting Customer buying behavior 
In this task, I learned How using data and predictive models helps British Airways acquire customers before they embark on their holidays. 
Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. British Airways tries to be proactive to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.
I spent some time exploring the dataset to understand the different columns and some basic statistics of the dataset, trained a machine learning model to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking, and evaluated how well it performed by conducting cross-validation and outputting appropriate evaluation metrics. Finally, my findings were summarized for presentation using PowerPoint/ Keynote.
